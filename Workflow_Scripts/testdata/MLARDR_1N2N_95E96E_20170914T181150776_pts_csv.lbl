Each line matches a record in an MLA RDR product with the addition of the Product Id and altitude. 
The MLA RDR products provide absolute radial distance from the center of mass of Mercury, which 
uses a Mercury reference radius of 2439.4 km. The altitude is calculated by subtracting the Mercury 
reference radius from the product record radius value.
Please see the MLA RDR SIS for details about the columns at
