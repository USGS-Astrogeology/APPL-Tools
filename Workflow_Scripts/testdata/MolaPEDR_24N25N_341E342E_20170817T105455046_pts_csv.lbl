DESCRIPTION                = "This product is a set of selected
  fields from selected MOLA PEDR records in Comma Separated format (CSV). 
  The table was generated by the NASA Planetary Data System - Geosciences 
  Node's Orbital Data Explorer tool based on a set of user 
  inputs parameters.
 The file(s) were generated at 2017-08-17T10:54:56.218
 with the following query parameters: 
    Min Lat: 23.8007812500006
    Max Lat: 25.1015625000006
    Westernmost Lon: 340.796875000001
    Easternmost Lon: 341.898437500001
  The tables contain MOLA topography, location, time, and 
  instrument data in a comma-delimited, customizeable format
  with names in a one-Line heading.  The information in 
  these files is obtained from the binary
  MOLA PEDR  tables."
